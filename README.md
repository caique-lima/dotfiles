This repository contains my personal dotfiles.

There is a shell script (`install.sh`) to do the basic setup and prepare
the environment for the use of `homesick`, the dotfiles manager I am using
to manage my dotfiles and each version of them.

I am keeping my main dotfiles version on the `personal` branch. But there will
be other branches, for more specific contexts, such as some jobs or projects.

VERSIONS
========

    - `personal`: My main and personal dotfiles.
    - `NCC`: dotfiles related to my work at UNESP/NCC.
